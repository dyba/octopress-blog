Hi! My name is Mieczys&#322;aw Daniel Dyba. Call me Daniel. I started developing in Ruby in late 2008 as a hobby. It has since become a very serious hobby.

I am a passionate independent learner. That is to say, I take full responsibility for my education and have a deep committment to personal growth. In 2008, I graduated from USC with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Mathematics.

After graduating from USC, I took up a position at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power where I currently work as a Network Security Engineer. My official title is Electrical Engineering Associate II. I have several responsibilities which include but are not limited to firewall administration, intrusion detection/prevention system administration, LAN and WAN deployments, and network security posture analysis.

I've lived in Los Angeles all my life. It is a city that is dear to me. When I'm not programming, I like to read and write.

You can sometimes catch me on IRC in #ruby-lang and #RubyOnRails. If you are interested in pair programming, send me an email at daniel [dot] dyba [at] gmail [dot] com, and we will set up a time to do Test Driven Development on code kata.
